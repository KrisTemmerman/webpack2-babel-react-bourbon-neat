webpack2-react-babel-scss boilerplate
===================

This package features an easy boilerplate to start developing react apps with scss and React.

## Instructions ##

Checkout the repository and run:
`npm install`
### Development ###
When the dependencies are installed you can run ```npm run dev```  to spin up a webpack-dev-server:

```
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
webpack output is served from /
```

### Production Build ###

 ```npm run build```   bundles your javascript into `bundle.js`  and your css into `main.css`

## TODO ##

 -  Add Image support ( file-loader)
 -  Add font-support 
 - 	Add a decent React App to load because Welcome to the Boilerplate is horrible.

### NOTES ###

This project is a side project I'm doing. Tips and suggestions are always welcome.
